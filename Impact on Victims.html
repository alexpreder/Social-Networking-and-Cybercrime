<p style = "font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Victims of cybercrime can suffer a range of impacts, both immediate and long-lasting. Financial loss is often the most direct consequence, but the emotional toll can be just as severe. Identity theft victims might spend years untangling the mess, dealing with fraudulent charges, and repairing their credit. Cyberbullying and harassment can lead to anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Victims of data breaches might experience stress and fear about their personal information being misused. The feeling of being violated and the loss of trust in online spaces can be particularly devastating. The road to recovery can be long and difficult, and support from friends, family, and professional services can be crucial.</p>

<h3 style = "text-align:center;">Psychological effects of cyberbullying
and harassment</h3>

<center>Brutal stuff. Victims of cyberbullying and harassment often suffer significant psychological impacts, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant fear and stress of being targeted can lead to sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and even physical symptoms like headaches or stomach problems.<br><br>

Long-term effects can be even more severe, sometimes leading to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The relentless nature of online harassment can make victims feel trapped, isolated, and hopeless. It's important to seek support from friends, family, and mental health professionals if you're dealing with this. No one should have to face it alone. </p><hr>
