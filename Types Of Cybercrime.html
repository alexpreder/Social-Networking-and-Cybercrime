<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Cyberbullying and harassment</h2>

<p style = "text-align:center;">Both of these are brutal, with long-lasting impacts on victims. Cyberbullying involves the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Harassment can be broader and includes persistent, unwanted actions such as threats, rumors, and public shaming.<br><br>

They can lead to severe emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and in extreme cases, even suicidal thoughts. Social media companies are trying to combat this with better reporting tools and stricter policies, but it's an uphill battle. The key is awareness and educationâ€”so we can all take steps to protect ourselves and others online.</p><hr>

<h3 style = "text-align:center;">Identity theft and impersonation</h3>
<p style = "text-align:center;">Identity theft and impersonation on social media are serious issues. Cybercriminals can steal personal information to create fake profiles, access accounts, or commit fraud. This can lead to financial loss, damage to reputation, and emotional distress for the victims.<br><br>

To protect yourself, it's crucial to use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious about sharing personal information online. Regularly monitoring your accounts for suspicious activity can also help you catch any issues early.<br><br></p><hr>

<h3 style = "text-align:center;">Privacy violations and data breaches
Cyberstalking and online threats</h3>
<p style = "text-align:center;"><b>Privacy violations and data breaches</b> are major concerns in the digital age. Privacy violations occur when personal information is collected, used, or shared without consent, often leading to unauthorized access and misuse.<br>
 Data breaches involve unauthorized access to sensitive data, which can result in identity theft, financial loss, and other serious consequences.<br><br>

<b>Cyberstalking and online threats</b> involve persistent and unwanted harassment or threats through digital means.<br>
 This can include sending threatening messages, spreading harmful rumors, or tracking someone's online activities.<br>
 Cyberstalking can cause significant emotional distress and fear for the victim.

Both issues highlight the importance of being vigilant and proactive about online safety.
