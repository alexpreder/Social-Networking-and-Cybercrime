<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Rise in cybercrime rates linked to social
nedia usage</h2>
<h3 style = "text-align:center;">The rise in cybercrime rates has indeed been linked to increased social media usage. As more people share personal information online, cybercriminals have more opportunities to exploit this data. <br>Here are some key points:<br><br></h3>

<p style = "text-align:center;"><b>Phishing Attacks:</b> Social media platforms are often used to launch phishing attacks, where cybercriminals create fake profiles or send malicious links to steal personal information.<br><br>

<b>Data Breaches:</b> With more data being shared on social media, the risk of data breaches increases. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities to access sensitive information.<br><br>

<b>Identity Theft:</b> Social media provides a wealth of personal information that can be used for identity theft, such as names, birthdates, and addresses.<br><br>

<b>Cyberstalking and Harassment:</b> The anonymity of social media can embolden cyberstalkers and harassers, leading to an increase in these types of crimes.<br><br>

The COVID-19 pandemic also saw a surge in cybercrime due to the increased reliance on social media for communication and work. It's crucial to stay vigilant and practice good cybersecurity habits to protect yourself online.</p><hr>
